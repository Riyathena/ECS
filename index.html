                        <p>We work with students of classes IX, X, XI and XII to help plan for their higher studies. It has been our
                            observation that most students and parents find this process scary, highly confusing and extremely
                            challenging. Our aim is to help them through this difficult phase of their journey towards a successful
                            college and career. Our programmes are designed specifically for this purpose.Parents and students are not able to keep up with these ever evolving dynamics between Education,
                            Employment and Industry. Many of the jobs which are the highest paying in their respective fields today
                            did not exist 10 years ago. We help students make sense of these scenarios and enable them to make
                            better decisions about their futures.</p>
